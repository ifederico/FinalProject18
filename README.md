WELCOME TO FANAGRAMS!

Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

Fanagrams is a quick game of identifying anagrams; the rearrangements of letters from a word to create another word.
Fanagrams is designed with two levels: Easy and Hard
Easy consists of 4 letter words while Hard consists of 6 letter words. The player gets the option to choose either level.
To play, the player must think of an anagram per word (of ten words). The player will have 3 guesses per round and will continue to the next round if 3 guesses are exceeded.
There can be multiple anagrams for each word, but the game will accept only one correct anagram. 
For the easy level, each correct anagram earns the player 5 points for a total of 50 points.
For the hard level, each correct anagram earns the player 10 points for a total of 100 points.
There are no deductions for incorrect anagrams.
There is no time limit during guessing.
Enjoy this quick brainteaser!
