WELCOME TO FANAGRAMS!

Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

Fanagrams is a quick game of identifying anagrams; the rearrangements of letters from a word to create another word.
Fanagrams is designed with two levels: Easy and Hard
Easy consists of 4 letter words while Hard consists of 6 letter words. The player gets the option to choose either level.
To play, the player must think of an anagram per word (of ten words). The player will have 3 guesses per round and will continue to the next round if 3 guesses are exceeded.
There can be multiple anagrams for each word, but the game will accept only one correct anagram. 
For the easy level, each correct anagram earns the player 5 points for a total of 50 points.
For the hard level, each correct anagram earns the player 10 points for a total of 100 points.
There are no deductions for incorrect anagrams.
There is no time limit during guessing.
Enjoy this quick brainteaser!
Shoutout to those who helped in the making of this game: Omay, Nikki, and Mrs. Gerstein! :)
